        Life is beautiful. Life is the most precious gift of God. Life is a
        treasure of jewels whose worth is immeasurable. Life shows all its
        colours and shades which may be dark and bright. The dark shades of life
        make us realize the depth of life because life is just not just a bed of
        roses. As it is rightly said, “The stream would have no song if it
        wouldn’t have rocks in its beds”. So, the trying, enduring episodes of
        life make us more insightful and patient. They make us view life from a
        different perspective, and help us explore new possibilities. The pains
        and sufferings in life make us judge the importance of pleasure that is
        the beauty of life.

        There is no dead end as such and there is no shortcut in life. What may
        seem adversity is actually an opportunity? As failures are the stepping
        stones to success and “success is counted the sweetest by who near
        succeed.”
